\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
This report serves as a re-confirmation that gravity does in fact exist\footnote{This document should not be used anywhere in respectable academic circles}

\end{abstract}

{\bf Keywords:} gravity

\section{Methods}

We dropped a pencil and observed whether it fell or not. 

\section{Data/Results}
We dropped a pencil 13 times. Each of those times, it did indeed fall to the ground. Please reference these physics equations that may or may not apply to this situation \\
\\
$\Sigma F = ma$\\
$x_f = x_i + v_i t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$

\section{Discussion/Conclusions}
Based on these results, we can conclude that gravity is real. \\
I will not be taking feedback on this statement
